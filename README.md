# SKKU FOR YOU

## Description

To stay up-to-date with the school news, there are multiple noticeboards that we must check often. This can be time-consuming and students may often forget to do it, and end up missing important announcements and opportunities. Because of that we created a board, which gathers the most recient news from your major and the main skku notice board (in the future users will be able to track more bords!). You can also save important notices if you want to check them at a later time!
